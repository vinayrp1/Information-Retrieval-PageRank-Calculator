Instructions to run scripts:
----------------------------

The folder consists of following python files

	1. page_rank.py
		1. This file consists of "PageRankCalculator" class which is imported by 2 other python files.
		2. DO NOT RUN THIS.
		3. This file has methods to calculate PageRank per iteration and till the values are converged.

	2. pageRankAtIterations.py
		1. This script outputs the page rank values at 1st, 10th and 100th iteration.
		1.   	python pageRankAtIterations.py <filename>
		2. If filename is empty, default file taken is "Graph_SmallSet"
		4. The values are also stored in "RankAtIterations.txt"

	3. lists_generator.py
		1. This script calculates page rank values and perplexity of the values.
		2. It continues to do so till the values are converged.
		3. At the end, 3 files are generated
				- PerplexityValues.txt: The perplexity values at each iteration till convergence
				- Top50_PageRank.txt  : Top 50 URLs with high page ranks
				- Top50_InLinks.txt	  : Top 50 URLS with high inlink count
		4. This script also outputs the proportion of urls with zero outlinks, zero inlinks and the urls with page ranks lesser than initial PR		
This folder also contains:

	1. Graph_LargeSet : Graph consisting of 183,811 nodes as given on course page
	2. Graph_SmallSet : Graph consisting of 6 nodes as given on course page

Statistical analysis:
---------------------

1. 7% URLs have zero inlinks
2. 36% URLs have zero outlinks
3. 78% URLs have lesser page rank than initial page rank
